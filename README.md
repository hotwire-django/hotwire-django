# Hotwire + Django

This repository aims to help you integrate [Hotwire](https://hotwire.dev/) with Django ðŸš€ Inspiration might be taken from [@hotwired/hotwire-rails](https://github.com/hotwired/hotwire-rails).

We are still in the early stage of this project so don't expect anything remotely production grade for a while.

Discussions about a Django/Hotwire integration are happening on the [Hotwire forum](https://discuss.hotwire.dev/t/django-backend-support-for-hotwire/1570). And on Slack, which you can join by [clicking here!](https://join.slack.com/t/pragmaticmindsgruppe/shared_invite/zt-kl0e0plt-uXGQ1PUt5yRohLNYcVvhhQ)

# Structure

As we discover this new magic, you can expect to see a few repositories with experiments and demos appear in [@hotwire-django](https://github.com/hotwire-django). If you too are experimenting, we encourage you to ask a write access to the GitHub organization and to publish your work in a @hotwire-django repository.

We expect to gain knowledge and experience with Hotwire over time and will try to extract useful code from the demos and package it in self contained "pip-installable" packages: [turbo-django](https://github.com/hotwire-django/turbo-django) and [stimulus-django](https://github.com/hotwire-django/stimulus-django).
